// 1. Write code to allow visitors of the page to customize it to their liking. There is a
// form on the page that accepts a name (to be used in a greeting when the user visits
// the page) and a color picker to allow the user to choose their preferred background
// color/foreground color combination. Write the necessary code to capture these values
// when the form is submitted (prevent the default action on the form submission button to
// achieve this) and store these values in localStorage (so that it persists on the userâ€™s
// computer and their preferences are saved indefinitely). Next, write a function to apply
// the preferences if they have been set and call it each time the page loads. You may
// also want to call this function again when the user saves their preferences to
// immediately apply them. Make sure you also notify the user somehow that the preferences
// were saved.

// this function will be called when the form is submitted
function savePreferences(event){
    //this prevents the default form submission action to avoid reloading the page
    event.prevent();
    
    //get the user's name from input field
    const name = document.getElementById(name).value;
    
    //gets the select a background color from the color picker 
    const bgColor = document.getElementById('bg-color').value;

    //gets the selected text color form the color picker
    const fgColor = document.getElementById('fg-color').value;

    // this saves the user's preferences in localstorage
    localStorage.setItem('userName', name);//saves the name
    localStorage.setItem('bgColor', bgColor);//saves the background color
    localStorage.setItem('fgColor', fgColor);//saves the text color

    // notifies the user that their preferences have been saved
    alert('Your preferences have been saves')
}

//this will apply the saved preferences 
function applyPreferences(){    
    // this will retrieve the saved preferences from the localstorage
    const savedName = localStorage.getItem('userName');
    const savedBgColor = localStorage.getItem('bgColor');
    const savedFgColor = localStorage.getItem('fgColor');
